In this Google colab notebook I present a generic machine learning multi classifier that can be applied to multiples datasets.

This notebook also provides a generic plotting capability to compare performance of several machine learning algorithms. This plotting allows selecting which is the best machine learning for an specific dataset.

As an example, in this notebook I am applying the machine learning multi classifier for classifying Dactilology images.

The dataset is not including here however can be downloaded from the following link:

This notebook uses sklearn library to compare several machine learning algorithms, below a list of few of them however it can be easily expanded to compare any other sklearn machine learning classifier:

* Extra Trees
* Random Forest
* Bagging Forest
* KNeighborsClassifier
* SVC
* DecisionTreeClassifier
* GaussianProcessClassifier
* MLPClassifier
* AdaBoostClassifier
* DecisionTrees
* Naive Bayes
* QuadraticDiscriminantAnalysis
* Logistic Regression
